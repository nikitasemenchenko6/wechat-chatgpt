Using railway & docker deployment, there may be problems that cannot be solved, we are working on it.

## Config

### Copy config

You need copy config file for setting up your project.

```sh
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

### Get and config Openai account

> If you don't have this OpenAI account and you live in China, you can get it [here](https://mirror.xyz/boxchen.eth/9O9CSqyKDj4BKUIil7NC1Sa1LJM-3hsPqaeW_QjfFBc).

#### Use account and password

You need get OpenAI account and password.
Your config.yaml should be like this:

```yaml
chatGPTAccountPool:
  - email: <your email>
    password: <your password>
# if you hope only some keywords can trigger chatgpt on private chat, you can set it like this:
chatPrivateTiggerKeyword: ""
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Trigger keywords must appear in the first position of the received message.
‚ö†Ô∏è Pls make sure your network can log in to OpenAI, and if you fail to login in try setting up a proxy or using SessionToken.

**Setup proxy:**

You can configure in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
openAIProxy: <Your Proxy>
```

### CAPTCHAS

> The browser portions of this package use Puppeteer to automate as much as possible, including solving all CAPTCHAs. üî•

> Basic Cloudflare CAPTCHAs are handled by default, but if you want to automate the email + password Recaptchas, you'll need to sign up for one of these paid providers:

> - [nopecha](https://nopecha.com/) - Uses AI to solve CAPTCHAS
>   - Faster and cheaper
>   - Set the `NOPECHA_KEY` env var to your nopecha API key
>   - [Demo video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/552829/208235991-de4890f2-e7ba-4b42-bf55-4fcd792d4b19.mp4) of nopecha solving the login Recaptcha (41 seconds)
> - [2captcha](https://2captcha.com) - Uses real people to solve CAPTCHAS
>   - More well-known solution that's been around longer
>   - Set the `CAPTCHA_TOKEN` env var to your 2captcha API token

So you should config `NOPECHA_KEY` or `CAPTCHA_TOKEN` in your Environment Variables.
